# Item Orbs

The six `AIDB`-parent attack orbs (`AIfb` fire, `AIlb` lightning, `AIob`
frost, `AIpb` poison, `AIcb` corruption, `AIzb` freeze) share one data
shape: `DataA` bonus damage, single level, self `code=`. `AIcb` also
authors `DataB` and all TFT rows carry `DataE=2`; neither has a consumer
yet. Do not register them on the guessed spell procs from the old TODOs
(`CAbilityOnFireHuman`, `CAbilityFrostNova`, `CAbilityImmolation`) —
those are wrong-class mappings of the same kind the creep-alias cleanup
unregistered.

## Mapping

| Orb | BuffID (TFT; ROC omits) | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AIfb` | none | damage only |
| `AIlb` | none | damage only |
| `AIob` | `Bfro` | damage + frost state, `Dur`/`HeroDur` |
| `AIpb` | none | damage only |
| `AIcb` | `BIcb` | damage + corruption state, `Dur`/`HeroDur` |
| `AIzb` | `Bfre` | damage + freeze state (`Dur` 0 = indefinite) |

All six rows use `CAbilityAttackBonus` with flags `0`, exactly like
`AIat`: pickup applies `DataA` to `temporaryDamageBonus`, drop reverses
it. `S_OrbOnHit` in `s_item_stats.c` applies the BuffID state from
`S_ResolveAttackHit` next to `S_SlowPoisonOnHit`, checking native orb
ownership and held orb items (the same orb from both applies once).
Buffs are state-only like Frost Nova's `Bfro`: no movement/armor
consumer reads `Bfro`/`BIcb`/`Bfre` yet.

Retail's pinned 1.29.2 class registry has a more specific implementation
split: `AIob` registers as `CAbilityFrostDamageBonus` (`AIDB` parent), while
`AIpb` registers as `CAbilityPoisonDamageBonus` (`AIDB` parent). The other
orb rows should be checked individually before treating OpenRealm's common
`CAbilityAttackBonus` procedure as a Retail class match. Class registration
proves the concrete class association, not the hit callback or full behavior;
see [the extracted TFT class inventory](../../../games/warcraft-3/tft-ability-classes.txt)
and [Retail shared-helper notes](ability-shared-native-functions.md).

## Attack Damage Bonus Aliases

The passive item attack damage family is also handled by `CAbilityAttackBonus`.
TFT aliases `AIt6`, `AIt9`, `AItc`, `AItf`, `AItg`, `AIth`, `AIti`,
`AItj`, `AItk`, `AItl`, `AItn`, and `AItx` share `AIat`'s `DataA`
pickup/removal behavior. Their values come from each alias's own AbilityData
row, so an item carrying `AItg` uses its authored +1 while `AItx` uses +20.
ROC includes the `+6`, `+9`, `+12`, and `+15` aliases; the remaining aliases
are TFT-only. The registry maps all twelve directly to the same procedure.

## Verification

```sh
build/bin/ability_audit -data 'data/Warcraft III' -raw AIob
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_item_lifecycle.*'
