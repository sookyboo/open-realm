# Team Resources And Advanced Shared Control

## Contract

Warcraft III has directional passive alliances, basic shared control, and advanced
shared control. The viewer is the first index of `level.alliances[viewer][owner]`.
`G_UnitCanControl` allows ordinary orders when the viewer treats the unit owner
as a passive ally and either control flag is set. `G_UnitCanSpendResources`
requires advanced control for an allied unit, while the owning player can always
use their own active unit. Neither helper transfers resource ownership.

A controller of another player's Barracks must spend the *owner's* gold and lumber,
not the controller's. Resource costs are charged by the producer/research/revival
paths against the producer's owning player. An advanced-control bit by itself
must not convert a hostile player into a friendly controllable army.

## Implemented Paths

| Surface | Authority boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Normal allied move/attack/hold and selection | `G_UnitCanControl` |
| Training and reviving a Hero via `CLIENTCOMMAND(Button)` | `G_UnitCanSpendResources` |
| Research, building upgrades | `CLIENTCOMMAND(Research/Upgrade)` advanced gate |
| Worker construction placement menu and click | `s_build.c` advanced gate |
| Production queue cancellation and cancel command | `G_UnitCanSpendResources` |
| Production command-card display | `Get_Commands_f` disables spending buttons without advanced sharing |
| Alliance changes | `G_SetPlayerAlliance` invalidates shortcuts and source player's command card |

The permission checks apply to *player-initiated* orders; internal AI, map script
and simulation calls such as `SP_TrainUnit` deliberately do not require a local
UI controller. This is essential for bots and campaign triggers.

## Unimplemented And Unverified

- A provisional Team Resources `svc_layout` renderer now exists on `LAYER_GAME_2`.
  It shows eligible allies' names, gold, lumber and used/cap food values.
  Custom multiboards take precedence, and multiboard suppression hides the panel.
- The retail board's exact stock FDF geometry, minimize buttons, custom-board fallback priority,
  and food display formatting remain unverified against retail assets.
  Current geometry is provisional, not pixel-perfect.
- The F11 Allies dialog has a single stock Units checkbox. It displays either
  basic or advanced shared-control permission as checked; turning it off stages
  revocation of both permissions, and accepting the dialog applies both bits.
  Turning it on grants basic control only. A separate advanced-control control
  is not present, and no unverified retail UI has been invented.
- The F11 dialog's grant/revoke normalization is regression-covered by
  `wc3_allies.*` tests in `hud/hud_allies.c`.
- Multiplayer abandoned-player transitions and any rejoin-specific policy are
  not implemented here.
- Individual ability-driven resource spending and neutral shop purchases need
  separate path-by-path inspection; stock unit production guards do not prove
  coverage of every custom ability.
- There are permission helper tests and command-card invalidation tests, but
  not full multiplayer command-level end-to-end integration coverage.

## Verification

The relevant source is `g_commands.c`, `g_utils.c`, `hud/hud_infopanel.c`,
`hud/hud_allies.c`, `skills/s_build.c` and `skills/s_train.c`.
Regression tests live in `tests/t_api.c`, `tests/t_building.c`, and
`hud/hud_allies.c`.

Suggested local checks (not run when producing this patch):

```sh
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_api.advanced_shared_control*'
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_building.advanced_control*'
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_allies.*'
make test
```

## Team Resources Display Wiring

`G_CanViewTeamResources(viewer, owner)` drives eligibility. The UI reads the
owner's authoritative resource state; normal harvesting, spending and resource
bar invalidation trigger refreshes for permitted viewers. Alliance mutations
invalidate the source viewer's panel. A map-created multiboard uses the same
`WC3_LAYER_MULTIBOARD` slot rather than rendering alongside Team Resources.

The UI does not grant sharing or transfer resources. A client cannot obtain
resource values for non-eligible players through this panel.
