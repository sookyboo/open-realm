# Leaderboards And Counted Objective HUDs

OpenRealm implements Warcraft III leaderboards as server-owned JASS state rendered through the stock `UI\\FrameDef\\UI\\LeaderBoard.fdf` frame. This covers campaign-style counted objectives such as a title plus a numeric row that changes as units are trained.

## Ownership

A leaderboard handle owns its label, display flag, style defaults, ordered items, colors, and requested row count. Each item owns a copied label, integer value, optional player number, item style flags, and optional label/value color overrides. The map/JASS script owns the actual counter; the leaderboard only stores and presents values supplied through natives such as `LeaderboardSetItemValue`.

`PlayerSetLeaderboard` stores one leaderboard registry index per Warcraft player. A board is visible to a client only when that player is assigned the board and its per-client `LeaderboardDisplay(lb, true)` visibility bit is set. Global calls affect all client slots; calls in `GetLocalPlayer()` context affect only that player. Switching assignments does not destroy either board.

## Implemented Native Surface

All 27 leaderboard natives registered by `api_module.c` are backed by state:

- create/destroy, display/query, item count, requested row sizing;
- add/remove/remove-player/clear;
- stable sort by value, player, or label in either direction;
- player-item membership/index lookup;
- board label get/set;
- per-player assignment get/set;
- board title/value colors and board style flags;
- item value/label/style and item label/value colors.

Strings pass through `G_LevelString()` on mutation, so map `TRIGSTR_` strings follow the existing WTS path. Native item indexes are zero-based.

## HUD

`UI_LoadHudLeaderboards()` loads the authored `LeaderBoard.fdf` root, backdrop, title, and list container. `LAYER_LEADERBOARD` is a dedicated server-authored layout layer appended after the timer-dialog layer, so leaderboard refreshes do not resend unrelated HUD panels.

The stock title/backdrop/container provide the board chrome. Runtime rows are emitted as text frames parented to `LeaderboardListContainer`: a natural-width left name/label and a natural-width right integer value. The server does not pick a "widest" row by `strlen`. It sends every visible title and `label    value` line as one newline-separated measurement string; `R_GetTextSize()` returns the widest rendered line in the proportional font, and the client sizes the board root to that width plus the stock edge inset. Row height still follows the authored title font with a conservative fallback.

The common campaign-counter case therefore renders as a stock leaderboard title plus a changing value without rebuilding the leaderboard handle.
When a board has a title but no items, the title remains visible and the empty list container is hidden; no placeholder row is reserved.

`LeaderboardSetSizeByItemCount` controls the number of presented row slots; it does not mutate `LeaderboardGetItemCount`.

## Save/Load And Reconnect

Save format version 24 persists the fixed leaderboard registry, all item/style/color state, player assignments, and JASS `leaderboard` handle identity through stable registry indexes. Layout payloads are transient; load marks connected clients dirty so the board is republished on the next server frame. `ClientBegin` also publishes the assigned board for a joining/reconnecting client.

## Known Limits

- `showIcons` and per-item `showIcon` are stored but icons are not rendered yet because classic icon source/packing semantics are not established confidently.
- Exact retail player-color/name styling remains to be pixel-matched. Row text and backdrop width are content-sized rather than hard-coded to a campaign-specific fixed width.
- Only the player's assigned leaderboard is presented, matching the `PlayerSetLeaderboard` ownership model. Multiboard is a separate widget; see [multiboard-and-texttag.md](multiboard-and-texttag.md).

These limits do not block the counted-objective path where a campaign script creates a board, assigns it to the player, adds one numeric row, and updates that row from 0 through a target value.

## Regression Coverage

Tests cover creation, labels, item insertion/update, stable sorting/player lookup, assignment/display state, and save/load restoration of handle alias identity and item/color state.

## Compact HUD Placement

The board is anchored to the same widescreen-aware top-right position and top offset as the TimerDialog. When the client has a visible TimerDialog, the board moves below that dialog with a small authored gap; a client with no visible timer keeps the original top position. Its root/backdrop width is measured from the visible title and rows, while its height and list container are compacted to the actual visible row count.
