# Warcraft III Music Playback

## Contract

Warcraft music is long-form client presentation, not an ordinary `sound` handle and not positional world audio. The Warcraft game module owns JASS semantics and Warcraft data lookup; the generic client owns playlist playback; the sound mixer owns decoded PCM streams.

```text
war3map.j
    -> SetMapMusic / PlayMusic / thematic natives
    -> games/warcraft-3/game/g_music.c
         -> per-recipient war3skins.txt lookup
         -> Music.slk alias expansion
         -> reliable svc_music
    -> client/cl_parse.c
    -> client/cl_music.c
         -> playlist state
         -> optional FFmpeg decode
         -> S_STREAM_MUSIC
    -> sound/s_sound.c
    -> SDL audio device
```

Do not route background music through `svc_sound`, `S_PlaySoundFile`, unit channels, or a world entity. One-shot WAV and MP3 sounds use the separate sound cache; background music keeps its independent playlist, seek, fade, and streaming lifetime.

## Build Modes

The default build keeps FFmpeg optional. Music commands and state still exist without FFmpeg, but no compressed music decoder is available and playback remains silent.

Enable the decoder with:

```bash
make FFMPEG=1
```

The Warcraft III build already uses these pkg-config libraries for pre-rendered movies and now reuses them for music:

```text
libavformat
libavcodec
libavutil
libswscale
libswresample
```

`client/cl_music.c` only requires audio demux/decode/resampling; `libswscale` remains part of the shared Warcraft FFmpeg build because movies need it.

## Warcraft Data Lookup

### `war3skins.txt`

JASS usually refers to a logical skin name such as:

```jass
call SetMapMusic("Music", true, 0)
```

`Theme_PlayerString()` resolves that value for the represented local player:

1. map-authored `war3mapSkin.txt` `[CustomSkin]` override;
2. race section (`Human`, `Orc`, `Undead`, `NightElf`);
3. `Default` section fallback;
4. versioned `<field>_V0` for RoC or `<field>_V1` for TFT at the same override/base layer;
5. original JASS string as fallback.

The map skin is loaded after the map archive is mounted, so Game Interface overrides such as `Music_V0` / `Music_V1` win over stock `war3skins.txt`. This version fallback matches the existing menu theme resolver instead of making gameplay music invent a second skin policy.

Direct Warcraft paths containing `\\` bypass skin lookup and remain paths.

### `UI\\SoundInfo\\Music.slk`

Retail never shipped `Music.slk` in either MPQ, so the typed loader marks it optional: a missing file stays silent with zero rows, and `G_MusicData` keeps returning its static zero row. `G_MusicResolvePlaylist` (`g_music.c:30-54`) then falls back to the raw skin token as a direct path. The fixture MPQ ships a `Music.slk` with a `TestMusic` row so playlist alias expansion stays covered.

The real per-edition playlist comes from the skin layer, not the SLK. `Theme_PlayerString` first checks map `war3mapSkin.txt` `[CustomSkin]`, then the recipient's stock race/`Default` sections and their versioned `<field>_V0` (RoC) / `<field>_V1` (TFT) aliases. Only the resolved token is checked against `Music.slk` row names before `FileNames` expansion.

`Music.slk` is loaded as typed Warcraft metadata. Only two fields are needed by the current playback contract:

```text
row key
FileNames
```

For each semicolon-delimited skin/JASS token, `g_music.c` checks whether the token is a `Music.slk` row. If so, it substitutes `FileNames`; otherwise the token is retained as a direct path. `FileNames` may itself contain comma-delimited tracks.

The server sends the resulting path/playlist string to the correct client. The generic client then splits both `;` and `,` separators and never needs to understand Warcraft skins or SLKs.

## Startup And `ClientBegin`

`G_LoadMap()` starts `war3map.j main()` before the network client has necessarily completed `ClientBegin`. A packet-only music implementation therefore loses standard startup calls such as `SetMapMusic("Music", true, 0)`.

Music semantics are retained per Warcraft `GAMECLIENT` in `wc3MusicState_t` even while that slot is disconnected. `G_ClientBegin()` calls `G_MusicSyncClient()` after the slot becomes presentation-safe. The sync sends:

- ordinary music volume;
- thematic music volume;
- stored map music;
- any explicit/thematic current session that supersedes map music;
- paused state where applicable.

This is the same general rule used by other server-authored presentation state: JASS may mutate state before a client can receive layout/presentation packets, so the state must not exist only in the outgoing message buffer.

## Glue Music And User Music Options

The standalone Warcraft glue UI uses the same generic client music stream without routing menu state through the game DLL. `games/warcraft-3/menu/menu_main.c` resolves the stock skin fields and calls narrow menu-import callbacks:

- ordinary glue screens use `GlueMusic`;
- the game-setup/chat screen uses `ChatMusic`, falling back to `GlueMusic` if the chat field is absent;
- clearing the menu screen stops only the client `CL_MUSIC_SOURCE_MENU` session.

`client/cl_music.c` owns two archived user preferences:

```text
s_music        0/1, default 1
s_musicvolume  0.0..1.0, default 1.0
```

The main-menu Options/Sound `MusicCheckBox` and `MusicVolumeSlider` update those cvars immediately. The slider uses the min/max/step authored by its FDF instead of replacing them with a code-defined range, then maps that authored range to the archived `0.0..1.0` preference. The user gain multiplies, rather than replaces, Warcraft's JASS music/thematic `0..127` volumes. Disabling music pauses the long-form stream and its fade clock so re-enabling it resumes the same decoder/playlist position instead of silently advancing the soundtrack.

The in-game F10 Options button opens the stock `EscMenuOptionsPanel` category page; the Sound button switches to a standalone Sound page by hiding the category/navigation frame and showing its sibling `SoundPanel`. The shared `BottomButtonPanel` is hidden on the category page and shown with Sound, keeping OK/Cancel on the Sound page. Sound reuses the same local `s_music` / `s_musicvolume` preferences. Its controls use fixed client-owned transient-window audio actions rather than arbitrary CVar commands, so a multiplayer server cannot select or overwrite unrelated local preferences. The Sound checkbox/slider similarly use `s_sound` / `s_volume` for ordinary one-shot effects. Gameplay, Video, and Network page bodies remain hidden, and unsupported category buttons and mixer controls remain disabled. `NetworkPanel` is a separate direct child of `EscMenuOptionsPanel`, so it must be explicitly hidden alongside the Gameplay/Video/Sound siblings; `game/generated/esc_menu_options_panel.h` must be generated from the retail `War3x.mpq` FDF so that this panel is bound.

## JASS Semantics Implemented

### Map music

```text
SetMapMusic(name, random, index)
```

Stores the default map playlist. If no music is currently active, it also becomes the active source, which makes generated map startup music audible after `ClientBegin`. If a map-music track is already audible, changing the map list does **not** cut that track off: the client retains the current list until that track reaches EOF, then starts the newly configured map list using its requested random/index policy.

```text
ClearMapMusic()
```

Clears the stored default playlist. It does not forcibly destroy an already audible current map track; that track is allowed to finish, then EOF becomes silence instead of advancing the old list.

### Explicit music

```text
PlayMusic(name)
```

Starts a temporary explicit playlist. OpenRealm treats Warcraft's random flag as **random initial song only**: the first playable entry is chosen randomly, then the remaining entries advance sequentially from that point. The explicit list is one-pass; after every playable entry in that pass has completed, map music is started again from the stored map-list policy. This is a compatibility policy inferred from Blizzard's "random initial song" terminology plus mapper observations; direct retail measurement can still revise it.

```text
PlayMusicEx(name, frommsecs, fadeinmsecs)
```

Uses the same one-pass lifecycle, starts the initial track from `frommsecs`, and applies a linear fade from zero to the configured music volume over `fadeinmsecs`.

### Stop / resume

```text
StopMusic(fadeOut)
ResumeMusic()
```

`StopMusic(false)` pauses the stream immediately while preserving decoder position and buffered data. `StopMusic(true)` applies a linear two-second fade from the music's current effective gain to silence, then pauses the same decoder; `ResumeMusic()` cancels any in-progress stop fade and resumes the same track at the configured music volume rather than advancing the playlist.

Warcraft exposes only the fade/no-fade boolean, not a duration. The **2000 ms** stop-fade constant is therefore an educated compatibility estimate based on mapper-era observations rather than a measured retail constant. Keep the duration isolated in `CL_MUSIC_STOP_FADE_MS` so a direct retail measurement can replace it without changing the lifecycle contract. If a fade-out begins during a `PlayMusicEx` fade-in, it starts from the current effective fade factor rather than jumping up to full volume first.

### Position and volume

```text
SetMusicVolume(0..127)
SetMusicPlayPosition(milliseconds)
```

Volume maps linearly to `0.0 .. 1.0` at the music stream. Seeking uses FFmpeg's stream timestamp seek and resets decoder/resampler/PCM-buffer state before refill.

### Thematic music

```text
PlayThematicMusic(name)
PlayThematicMusicEx(name, frommsecs)
EndThematicMusic()
SetThematicMusicVolume(0..127)
SetThematicMusicPlayPosition(milliseconds)
```

Thematic music uses the one physical music stream but separate logical source/volume state. It is a temporary **one-shot** overlay:

- beginning thematic music snapshots the ordinary map/explicit session that it interrupts;
- thematic EOF automatically restores that session instead of advancing/looping the thematic playlist;
- `EndThematicMusic()` performs the same restoration early;
- a `SetMapMusic` / `ClearMapMusic` change made while an interrupted map track is underneath the theme remains pending and takes effect when that restored map track later reaches EOF.

The client snapshots the interrupted track index and the audible playback position before replacing its decoder. The generic PCM stream counts frames actually consumed by the audio device, so the snapshot excludes decoded-but-not-yet-heard buffered PCM. A `music_snapshot` acknowledgement writes that position and selected track back into the persisted `GAMECLIENT` restore descriptor; `EndThematicMusic()`, natural thematic EOF, reconnect, and save/load therefore restore the same ordinary session at the best available audible position. Exact sample-level retail behavior is not claimed, because FFmpeg seeks may land on an earlier codec key/frame boundary.

### Sound-file duration query

```text
GetSoundFileDuration(path) -> milliseconds
```

`GetSoundFileDuration` is synchronous JASS/server state, so it deliberately does **not** call the optional client FFmpeg decoder. `games/warcraft-3/game/g_audio_duration.c` reads the mounted VFS asset once and extracts duration from container/frame metadata without decoding PCM:

- RIFF/WAVE: prefers a `fact` sample count when present (for compressed WAV), otherwise uses `fmt ` byte rate plus accumulated `data` chunk sizes;
- MP3: skips ID3v2 and scans MPEG 1/2/2.5 Layer I/II/III frame headers, summing samples at each frame's sample rate so VBR files do not assume one bitrate;
- Ogg Vorbis: reads the identification-header sample rate and final page granule position;
- FLAC: reads STREAMINFO sample rate and total-sample count.

Missing, malformed, or unsupported files return `0`, matching the safe native fallback. This metadata path is available in both default and `FFMPEG=1` builds and keeps game/JASS ownership independent of client decoder availability.

## Playlist Behavior

The generic client stores at most 32 resolved paths for one active playlist. `random=true` affects only the initial selection. After the client reports the chosen track with `music_selected`, retained server state records that exact index and marks the current session sequential while leaving the stored map policy unchanged.

Persistent map music loops sequentially from that selected start point:

```text
playlist A B C D
random initial = C
C -> D -> A -> B -> C -> ...
```

Explicit `PlayMusic` / `PlayMusicEx` uses the same random-initial-then-sequential order but tracks which entries have already played. It does not replay a successful entry during the current pass; after the final playable entry, it restores map music. Missing/undecodable entries are skipped without consuming a successful-entry slot, so an `A(valid), B(missing), C(valid)` pass plays A/C once each rather than replaying A to compensate for B.

Thematic music is one-shot regardless of playlist length: the selected theme track restores the interrupted ordinary session at EOF rather than advancing.

These random-initial and explicit-one-pass rules are deliberate compatibility assumptions based on the strongest available Warcraft editor/community evidence, not a claim of direct retail instrumentation. They should be revised if a bounded retail test demonstrates different post-initial ordering.

When a selected path cannot be opened/decoded, the client scans the remaining playlist entries. An all-invalid map playlist becomes silent rather than indexing an empty array or terminating the map; later map replacement/clear acknowledges that silent session immediately because no EOF can arrive. An all-invalid explicit/theme request immediately completes its temporary lifecycle and restores the appropriate underlying/map state. No per-track debug logging is part of this path.

## Optional FFmpeg Decoder

`client/cl_music.c` follows the proven movie-audio pattern:

1. ask `FS_ResolveLoosePath()` for a normal disk path;
2. otherwise extract the virtual Warcraft asset to `openrealm-music.tmp` under the user path;
3. `avformat_open_input()` and locate the best audio stream;
4. open the codec with libavcodec;
5. resample incrementally to stereo S16 / 44.1 kHz with libswresample;
6. queue PCM into `S_STREAM_MUSIC`;
7. detect decoder EOF and advance the playlist after queued PCM drains.

The decoder does not load the full song into RAM. It targets roughly half a second of queued PCM while the mixer stream itself has a two-second capacity.

A future `AVIOContext` backed directly by the virtual filesystem could remove temporary extraction, but that is not required for correct first-pass playback.

## Generic PCM Streams

The former singleton movie `S_Raw*` buffer is now a generic pair of long-form PCM streams:

```text
S_STREAM_MOVIE
S_STREAM_MUSIC
```

Each stream independently owns:

- ring buffer;
- active flag;
- pause flag;
- volume;
- a monotonic consumed-frame counter reset by `S_StreamStart()`.

`S_StreamPlayedFrames()` is presentation timing, not simulation time. Music combines it with the last explicit seek/start millisecond to snapshot the position the audio device has actually consumed before thematic replacement.

The SDL callback mixes both streams before one-shot sound channels. Starting/stopping a movie stream therefore no longer resets music-buffer state.

Movies suspend music while they own full-screen presentation, then restore the previous music pause state when the movie ends or is skipped. See [pre-rendered-movies.md](pre-rendered-movies.md).

## Network Contract

`svc_music` is a reliable server-to-client presentation message. `musicCommand_t` is game-neutral and contains no Warcraft race/unit/spell identifiers.

The session synchronization fields are part of the current `svc_music` payloads, and the raw `GAMECLIENT` music record is persisted by the versioned save format. This is a deliberate compatibility boundary: clients and saves from before the session-state change are rejected by their existing exact-version checks rather than being decoded with the wrong field layout. Any future compatibility work must add an explicit version or negotiation path before changing these records again.

Current payloads:

| Command | Payload after command byte |
|---|---|
| `MUSIC_CMD_SET_MAP` | `byte random`, `long index`, `long session_id`, `string playlist` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_CLEAR_MAP` | none |
| `MUSIC_CMD_PLAY` | `byte random`, `long index`, `long start_ms`, `long fade_ms`, `long played_mask`, `long session_id`, `string playlist` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_STOP` | `byte fade_out` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_RESUME` | none |
| `MUSIC_CMD_PLAY_THEMATIC` | `long index`, `long start_ms`, `long session_id`, `string playlist` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_END_THEMATIC` | none |
| `MUSIC_CMD_SET_VOLUME` | `long 0..127` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_SET_POSITION` | `long milliseconds` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_SET_THEMATIC_VOLUME` | `long 0..127` |
| `MUSIC_CMD_SET_THEMATIC_POSITION` | `long milliseconds` |

Each new map/explicit/thematic session receives a per-client nonzero `session_id`. Client lifecycle acknowledgements echo this opaque id instead of reconstructing identity from playlist text or selected indexes; this avoids false rejection when `Music.slk` comma lists normalize differently, a random initial song is not index 0, or an undecodable entry falls through to a later path. Reliable client commands are:

| Client command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `music_selected <session> <index> <position_ms> <played_mask>` | selected/advanced to a playable track; updates retained exact index, one-pass progress, and start/seek position |
| `music_snapshot <theme_session> <restore_session> <index> <position_ms> <played_mask>` | theme has suspended an ordinary session at this audible position and one-pass progress |
| `music_finished <session>` | one-pass/theme/deferred-map session reached its lifecycle boundary |

The Warcraft game module resolves each recipient's skin before serialization. `GetLocalPlayer()`-scoped JASS uses `currentplayer`; global calls update/send each game-client slot independently. Reliable command ordering lets the client finish an old session, start the replacement locally, send `music_finished` for the old id, then `music_selected` for the replacement; the server commits the lifecycle transition before accepting the new selection. Stale ids are ignored after a newer session supersedes them.

## Compatibility Assumptions And Remaining Gaps

OpenRealm now implements three behaviors as explicit **best-evidence compatibility assumptions**, rather than leaving internally inconsistent placeholder behavior: `random=true` randomizes the initial song only and then proceeds sequentially; explicit `PlayMusic` is a one-pass override that returns to map music; and thematic music restores the interrupted track at its client-observed audible position. These choices are documented hypotheses and should change if direct retail measurement contradicts them.

The remaining unresolved areas are:

- `StopMusic(true)` uses a **2000 ms** linear fade as an educated compatibility estimate; the exact retail duration still needs direct measurement.
- codec seeking is millisecond/stream-time based rather than sample-exact; the consumed-frame snapshot identifies what the mixer heard, but FFmpeg may decode from an earlier seek boundary.
- the continuously advancing ordinary playback head is reported when tracks are selected and when thematic music snapshots it, not every frame; a save taken during ordinary music can therefore resume from the last reported start/seek rather than the exact current millisecond. A synchronous save-time client query would require an explicit prepare/acknowledge phase and is intentionally not faked.
- the in-game F10 Options Sound page now reuses the archived local music/SFX preferences; Ambient/Movement/Unit/Subtitles/environment/positional category controls remain disabled until their underlying routing is implemented.
- builds without `FFMPEG=1` have no compressed **playback** decoder. `GetSoundFileDuration` does not share that limitation because it reads metadata in the game module.

## Verification

No automated or local compile/run validation is implied by this document. With original game data, developer verification should cover both RoC and TFT builds.

Build with music decoding:

```bash
make FFMPEG=1
```

Useful behavioral cases:

1. Start a Human campaign map whose generated script calls `SetMapMusic("Music", true, 0)`; music should begin after connection without requiring a later trigger.
2. Repeat with another race and confirm the playlist follows that player's `war3skins.txt` section.
3. Exercise `SetMapMusic(..., true, 0)` with at least four tracks; note the random initial entry, then confirm subsequent EOF transitions advance sequentially and wrap.
4. While a map track is playing, call `SetMapMusic` with a different list; the audible track should finish before the new list starts. Repeat with `ClearMapMusic`; the audible track should finish and then stop.
5. Start map music, call `PlayMusic` with a multi-track list, and let the explicit list complete; each playable explicit track should occur once in sequential order from the random initial entry, then map music should return.
6. Start explicit or map music, note the audible timestamp, play a thematic track, and let it reach EOF without calling `EndThematicMusic`; the interrupted track should return at approximately the same audible position.
7. Repeat the thematic test with an early `EndThematicMusic()` and with a `war3mapSkin.txt` `[CustomSkin]` music override.
8. Exercise `PlayMusicEx` with a nonzero start position and fade-in.
9. `StopMusic(false)` then `ResumeMusic()`; the same track should continue rather than select the next track.
10. Call `StopMusic(true)` during steady playback and during a `PlayMusicEx` fade-in; volume should ramp smoothly to silence over approximately two seconds, then `ResumeMusic()` should continue the same track without a playlist advance.
11. Call `GetSoundFileDuration` for representative retail WAV and MP3 assets and compare the returned milliseconds with an external media-info tool; malformed/missing files should return `0`.
12. Enter the main menu/options/game-setup screens: `GlueMusic` should persist across ordinary glue navigation, `ChatMusic` should replace it in game setup when authored, and starting gameplay should clear menu music before map music takes ownership.
13. In Options -> Sound, disable Music and move the Music Volume slider; `s_music` / `s_musicvolume` should update immediately, disabling should pause rather than advance the current menu/game track, and re-enabling should resume it.
14. Play a pre-rendered movie while music is active; movie audio should play alone and music should resume afterward.
15. Build without `FFMPEG=1`; maps should still run without a music-decoder/link dependency, and `GetSoundFileDuration` metadata queries should still work even though compressed playback is silent.
