# Human07 Mission Troubleshooting

## Scope

This document records the Human07 (`Maps\\Campaign\\Human07.w3m`) investigation: the
mission-end check, `SuicidePlayer`, runtime-created buildings, the Town Hall Birth
regression, and the evidence used to distinguish the failures. It separates confirmed
engine fixes from observations that still require a complete in-game replay.

The map script is authoritative for the mission objective. Engine behavior must make
the script's queries and lifecycle operations observable; it must not replace the
script with a Human07-specific completion rule.

## Authoritative data and runtime path

The map was extracted from the local Warcraft III archive with:

```text
get +map Maps\\Campaign\\Human07.w3m
```

The relevant generated `war3map.j` code is `CheckGreenBuildings`. It counts the
qualifying Player 6 structures and explicitly excludes the rawcodes `uzg1` and
`uzig`. The optional Crypt handle `gg_unit_usep_0049` is removed by the map script on
Easy and Normal. Those are authored exceptions, not a general rule that all neutral
or unfinished structures should be ignored.

The runtime path for a JASS-created building is:

```text
war3map.j CreateUnit
  -> unit_create
  -> SP_SpawnAtLocationNoBirth
  -> SP_CallSpawn
  -> SP_SpawnUnit
  -> collision initialization
  -> gi.LinkEntity
  -> server broad-phase bounds / BoxEdicts
```

The no-birth path is specific to immediate JASS `CreateUnit`. Construction, training,
and callers that own a Birth or construction lifecycle continue to use
`SP_SpawnAtLocation()`.

## Problems and solutions

| Problem | Confirmed cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human07 did not finish after the visible enemy force was destroyed | `RemoveUnit` freed the edict while JASS trigger/group/entity iteration was still using the handle. The map's objective query could therefore observe stale or invalid state. | Hide the unit immediately, remove it from JASS groups and command state, then defer `G_FreeEdict` until the entity iteration has completed. `G_RunDeferredFrees()` runs after collision solving. |
| The campaign script could not launch its authored assault | OpenRealm did not expose the `SuicidePlayer` AI native used by the campaign AI path. | Implement and register `G_BotSuicidePlayer`: validate the AI player, target player, captain, and `check_full`; issue attack orders toward the target player's authored start location; launch live captain members and update captain state. |
| A runtime-created building could be walked through | `SP_SpawnAtLocationInternal()` linked the entity before `SP_CallSpawn()`. `SP_SpawnUnit()` populated building collision during spawn, but `SV_LinkEntity()` had already calculated zero-sized broad-phase bounds. `BoxEdicts()` consequently could not return the building as a blocker. | Call `SP_CallSpawn()` first and link afterward. This preserves the authored collision in the server spatial index. |
| The Town Hall could remain on the Birth model or retain a birth delay | `unit_create()` used the presentation-aware Birth path and then immediately requested Stand. Stand changed the animation but did not clear `edict.wait`, which still contained the authored build time. | Use `SP_SpawnAtLocationNoBirth()` in `unit_create()`, request Stand once, apply facing, and activate food. Immediate JASS creation now starts ready. |

The map-placed spawn path already called `SP_CallSpawn()` before linking. The
link-order defect therefore affected dynamically created units, not ordinary
map-placed entities.

## Implementation locations

- [`g_spawn.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/g_spawn.c) owns the post-spawn link
  ordering and the Birth/no-Birth spawn entry points.
- [`m_unit.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/m_unit.c) owns the JASS `CreateUnit`
  immediate-ready path.
- [`g_utils.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/g_utils.c) owns deferred edict
  retirement; [`g_main.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/g_main.c) drains it after
  the frame's entity iteration and collision solve.
- [`g_bot.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/g_bot.c), [`api_ai.h`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/api/api_ai.h),
  and [`api_module.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/api/api_module.c) own the
  `SuicidePlayer` native implementation and registration.

## Confirmed fixes

The following evidence is reproducible in the current tree:

- `wc3_api.removeunit_hides_before_deferred_edict_release`,
  `wc3_api.createunit_does_not_reuse_deferred_dead_unit`, and
  `wc3_api.killunit_processes_deferred_unit_handle` cover deferred unit removal and
  stale-handle behavior.
- `wc3_api.createunit_starts_ready_without_birth_delay` passes in both Classic and
  TFT data modes. It verifies Stand and `wait == 0` for an immediate `CreateUnit`.
- `wc3_api.createunit_links_building_collision_bounds` passes in both Classic and
  TFT data modes. It verifies collision-sized linked bounds and that `BoxEdicts()`
  returns the runtime-created building.
- The focused API tests passed 4/4 for the no-birth lifecycle and 11/11 for the
  building-link contract in each data mode.
- `make test-wc3-engine` passed `25739/25739` assertions in `1232` tests.
- `make -B openwarcraft3` completed successfully and `git diff --check` reported no
  whitespace errors.
- A bounded Human07 run made during the investigation progressed to Human08, which
  confirmed the mission-end/transition path for that run after the deferred removal
  and AI-native work. This is runtime evidence for that particular data set and
  scenario, not a replacement for the automated lifecycle tests.

The permanent regression tests are in
[`games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_api.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_api.c);
the AI behavior tests are in
[`games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_bot.c`](../../../games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_bot.c).

## Confirmed regressions during the investigation

These were real behavior regressions introduced by intermediate fixes and are now
covered or corrected:

1. Replacing `CreateUnit`'s Birth path with an immediate Stand request without also
   clearing the birth wait caused a Town Hall to appear stuck at Birth. The corrected
   no-birth path and `createunit_starts_ready_without_birth_delay` test address it.
2. Linking a spawned building before its class spawn initializer caused the building
   to be visually present but absent from broad-phase collision. The corrected link
   order and `createunit_links_building_collision_bounds` test address it.
3. One diagnostic test invocation was run concurrently with another invocation that
   edited the shared test MPQ fixture. That produced a test-process failure unrelated
   to gameplay code. Sequential reruns passed; keep Warcraft III fixture-mutating test
   commands serialized.

The latest inspected `openwarcraft3.log` was not evidence about Human07: its begin
line named `Maps\\Campaign\\Human04.w3m`. Always verify the `CL_SendBegin` map name
before interpreting a runtime log as a mission result.

## Warsmash comparison and remaining gap

The Warsmash sources in `screenshots/WarsmashModEngine` distinguish pure simulation
creation from presentation/construction creation:

- JASS `CreateUnit` reaches an immediate-ready creation path.
- A simple summoned unit may use Birth followed by a queued Stand.
- A building construction path explicitly enters constructing state and owns the
  Birth presentation.

OpenRealm now matches the important `CreateUnit` and building-construction ownership
boundary. The summon path still deserves a separate parity test because
`s_summon.c` uses the presentation-aware spawn path and then requests Stand directly;
that is a potential lifecycle difference, but no confirmed regression from it has
been recorded.

## Diagnostic workflow

Build the guarded diagnostics and run a bounded, correctly identified Human07 session:

```sh
make clean && make build FFMPEG=1 WC3_DEBUG_AI=1 && \
  ./build/bin/openwarcraft3 +set r_cursor 1 +set sv_cheats 1 \
  +com_frame_limit 120 +map Maps\\Campaign\\Human07.w3m 2>&1 | tee openwarcraft3.log
```

Check, in order:

1. `CL_SendBegin` names Human07.
2. `war3map.j` reaches `CheckGreenBuildings` after the expected enemy removals.
3. The optional Crypt exception matches the selected campaign difficulty.
4. Runtime-created buildings report authored collision and are returned by the
   spatial query rather than merely rendering a model.
5. JASS unit handles remain valid until the deferred-free pass, then become invalid.
6. `SuicidePlayer` reports a valid captain and target start location before issuing
   the assault.

The detailed AI trace is guarded by `WC3_DEBUG_AI=1`; it is intentionally disabled by
default. Relevant implementation details are documented in
[`Runtime Unit Spawn Lifecycle`](unit-spawn-lifecycle.md) and
[`Warcraft III Player AI`](player-ai.md).

## Verification commands

Run focused tests independently when diagnosing either lifecycle issue:

```sh
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_api.createunit_starts_ready_without_birth_delay'
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_api.createunit_links_building_collision_bounds'
make test-wc3-engine
```

The automated tests prove state, handle, and spatial-index contracts. A complete
Human07 replay remains useful for validating the final camera, trigger, and campaign
transition presentation because those visual effects are outside the focused harness.
