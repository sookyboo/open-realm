# Purge

## Contract

`Aprg` is `CAbilityPurge` (parent `AAsm`). `Apg2` is a TFT melee alias whose
`code` is `Aprg`, so it shares `CAbilityPurge` and reads its own row through
`abilityitem_t.code`. Item `AIlp` (`CAbilityLightningPurge`, parent `Aprg`) is
registered on the same procedure. Creep `ACpu` also has `code=Aprg` but remains
unregistered here. Orb/totem `AIpg` / `AIps` are out of scope.

| Rawcode | Archive | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Aprg` | ROC and TFT | classic Purge (no pause) |
| `Apg2` | TFT only | Shaman melee Purge; adds unit/hero pause |
| `AIlp` | ROC and TFT | Item Purge / Lightning Purge |
| `ACpu` | ROC and TFT | creep Purge — unregistered |

Casting strips every timed status from the target, applies the Purge slow buff,
and deals `DataC` damage when `target->owner` is set (summoned).

## Authored fields

WorldEdit `AbilityMetaData` labels (`WESTRING_AEVAL_PRG*`):

| Field | Stock `Aprg` | Stock `Apg2` | Meta name | Runtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `DataA` | 5 | 5 | Movement Update Frequency | initial slow; see below |
| `DataB` | 0 | 0 | Attack Update Frequency | unused |
| `DataC` | 400 | 400 | Summoned Unit Damage | `S_SpellDamage` when `owner` set |
| `DataD` | 0 | 3 | Unit Pause Duration | non-hero immobilize window (seconds) |
| `DataE` | 0 | 1 | Hero Pause Duration | hero immobilize window (seconds) |
| `DataF` | — | — | Mana Loss | unused |
| `Dur` / `HeroDur` | 15 / 5 | 15 / 5 | — | slow buff lifetime (`Bprg`) |
| `BuffID` | empty (ROC) / `Bprg` (TFT) | `Bprg` | — | empty falls back to `Bprg` |

`Apg2` ubertip: enemy units are immobilized for `<DataD>` seconds, then slowed
by a factor of `<DataA>` while recovering over `<Dur>`. Immobilization is a
move lock (reject `order_move`, 100% `S_PurgeMoveReduction`), not a separate
stun buff. Do not treat stock `DataA=5` as “zero speed”; pause comes from
`DataD`/`DataE`.

### DataA slow + gradual recovery

Ubertip “factor of DataA” means stock `DataA=5` starts at speed `1/5`. Fixtures
often author a remaining-speed complement in `(0,1]` (e.g. `0.5`); those use
`1 - DataA` as the initial reduction. `DataA <= 0` is a full stop.

After any pause window, reduction lerps from that initial value down to `0`
over the remaining buff lifetime (`Dur - pause`). At the instant pause ends,
reduction is still the full initial slow; later samples are weaker.

## Data Flow

```text
AbilityData.slk (Aprg / Apg2 / AIlp)
  -> DataA/C/D/E, Dur/HeroDur, BuffID, targs, Cost, Rng
CAbilityPurge
  -> clear timed statuses (skip S_StatusIsUndispellable; Cyclone DataA==0)
  -> unit_addtimedstatus(BuffID or Bprg); store spell->code in status.data
  -> S_SpellDamage(DataC) when target->owner
S_PurgeMoveReduction / S_PurgeIsImmobilized
  -> read DataA/D/E from status.data (casting rawcode), not hardcoded Aprg
  -> after pause: initial slow * (1 - elapsed_after_pause / slow_window)
s_move order_move / ai_move_walk
  -> S_PurgeIsImmobilized rejects/stops translation (same family as Bens/BEer)
```

Purge ubertip says “Removes all buffs”, but Cyclone authors `Can Be Dispelled`
(`DataA`). ROC `DataA=0` cyclone survives Purge's clear loop; TFT non-zero does
not. Unit-target selection of an already-cycloned unit is still blocked by
`S_SpellAllowsTarget`; see [Cyclone](cyclone.md).

## Diagnostic Workflow

```sh
build/bin/ability_audit -data 'data/Warcraft III' -raw Aprg
build/bin/ability_audit -data 'data/Warcraft III' -raw Apg2
build/bin/ability_audit -data 'data/Warcraft III' -raw AIlp
```

## Verification

```sh
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_spell.purge*'
```

Focused tests cover alias procedure sharing, Aprg authored DataA slow,
Apg2 DataD immobilize + expiry restore, Hero DataE pause, summoned DataC
damage, and gradual post-pause recovery. Existing `t_spell.c` Purge cases must
keep passing.

### Retail JASS observation (October 4, 2026)

Stock TFT `Apg2` was attached to independent Player 0 Blood Mage casters and
cast on moving Footmen. Each target had an unpurged Footman control on a nearby
parallel lane. For the allied case, both targets belonged to Player 0; for the
hostile case, the target belonged to Player 12. Both casts spent approximately
the authored 75 mana after accounting for regeneration, confirming completed
casts. At 1.5 seconds after casting, the allied target had moved 382.881 units
versus 403.491 for its control. The hostile target had moved 80.865 versus
385.253 for its control, and at 3.5 seconds had moved 108.837 versus 608.150.
This supports the retail tooltip contract: `Apg2` movement immobilization and
reduction applies to enemies, while an allied target is accepted without a
comparable movement effect. The probe does not establish an exact pause
duration or slow curve, or whether the allied cast dispels buffs. See the full
probe setup and raw output in [ability verification review](ability-verification-review.md#retail-purge-friendly-and-hostile-target-verification-october-4-2026).
